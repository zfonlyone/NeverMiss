- Auto-restart option for new cycle (toggle, default: enabled)

#### 2.1.2 Task Editing
Users shall be able to edit all properties of existing tasks at any time.

#### 2.1.3 Task Deletion
Users shall be able to delete tasks with a confirmation prompt.

#### 2.1.4 Task List View

- Next occurrence date/time
- Status (upcoming, due, completed, failed)
- Visual indicators for recurring tasks

### 2.2 Task Recurrence

#### 2.2.1 Recurrence Options
The app shall support the following recurrence patterns:

- Custom (user-defined days/hours/minutes)

#### 2.2.2 Task Cycles
- Each task shall have distinct cycles based on the recurrence pattern
- Completion status shall be tracked individually for each cycle
- Historical data for all cycles shall be maintained

#### 2.2.3 Automatic Cycle Progression
- If a task is not marked as completed within its cycle period, it shall automatically:
  - Record the current cycle as "failed"
  - Store the failure timestamp
  - Begin a new cycle based on the recurrence pattern

### 2.3 Task Completion

#### 2.3.1 Completion Marking
Users shall be able to mark tasks as completed with the following steps:
- Select a task from the list
- Tap "Complete" button
- Choose whether to restart the cycle (if auto-restart is disabled)
- The system shall record the completion timestamp

#### 2.3.2 Cycle Restart Options
When completing a task, users shall be presented with options to:
- Restart the cycle (if auto-restart is disabled)
- End the task sequence (no more cycles)

#### 2.3.3 Completion History
The app shall maintain a history of all task completions with timestamps.

### 2.4 Notifications

#### 2.4.1 Reminder Notifications
- The app shall send notifications based on the pre-task reminder time
- Notifications shall include:
  - Task name
  - Scheduled time
  - Quick action to mark as completed

#### 2.4.2 Notification Management
Users shall be able to:
- Enable/disable notifications per task
- Set custom sounds for notifications
- Set vibration patterns for notifications

### 2.5 Data Management

#### 2.5.1 Data Export
Users shall be able to export their task data in the following formats:
- JSON (for system interoperability)
- CSV (for user readability)

#### 2.5.2 Data Import
Users shall be able to import task data from previously exported files.

#### 2.5.3 Data Migration
The app shall support migrating data:
- Between devices
- Between operating systems (Android to iOS and vice versa)
- Through cloud storage options

#### 2.5.4 Data Backup
The app shall provide options for:
- Automatic cloud backups (if user enabled)
- Manual local backups
- Backup scheduling

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Data Storage

#### 3.1.1 Local Database
- The app shall use SQLite for local data storage
- Database schema shall include tables for:
  - Tasks (task details)
  - TaskCycles (cycle tracking)
  - CompletionHistory (completion timestamps)
  - FailureHistory (failure timestamps)

#### 3.1.2 Data Structure
Task object shall contain:
```
{
  id: UUID,
  name: String,
  startDateTime: DateTime,
  recurrenceInterval: {
    type: String, // hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, custom
    value: Number, // count of units
    unit: String // hours, days, weeks, months (if custom)
  },
  reminderOffset: Number, // minutes before task to send notification
  autoRestart: Boolean,
  isActive: Boolean,
  createdAt: DateTime,
  updatedAt: DateTime
}
```

TaskCycle object shall contain:
```
{
  id: UUID,
  taskId: UUID,
  cycleStartDateTime: DateTime,
  cycleEndDateTime: DateTime,
  status: String, // pending, completed, failed
  completedAt: DateTime (nullable),
  failedAt: DateTime (nullable)
}
```

### 3.2 System Integration

#### 3.2.1 Notification System
- Android: Use NotificationManager and AlarmManager
- iOS: Use UserNotifications framework

#### 3.2.2 Background Processing
- Android: Use WorkManager for reliable background task scheduling
- iOS: Use Background Tasks framework

#### 3.2.3 File System Access
- The app shall request appropriate permissions for reading/writing files for import/export functionality

### 3.3 Cross-Platform Considerations

#### 3.3.1 Data Format Compatibility
- All exported data shall use UTF-8 encoding
- Timestamps shall be stored in ISO 8601 format
- Data structures shall be compatible across platforms

#### 3.3.2 UI/UX Consistency
